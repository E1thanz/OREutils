## OREutils
simple QoL mod for the **ORE minecraft server**  
commands include:
* `/bl show` - shows blocked username list
* `/bl add [username]` - adds a username to the block list
* `/bl remove [username]` - removes a username from the block list
* `/bpos1 [x] [z]` - sets the first corner of a plot
* `/bpos2 [x] [z]` - sets the second corner of a plot
* `/kos [true/false]` - sets kick on sight to true or false
* `/hb [true/false]` - sets hide blocked players to true or false  

it also adds autocompletion and shortening to server switching commands:
* `/build, /b`
* `/school, /s`
* `/competition`
* `/seasonal`

in addition it also says "wb" automatically anytime someone not from your blocklist joins
this can be turned off with `/autowb false`
